Simulation Parameters 
Model 
  •	Simple Model A
  •	Simple Model B 

-	Main heat sources
  o	Peltier area (26 W) 
  o	Back heat source area  (61W) 

-	Fluid properties (Water) 
  o	Flow rate 1 (L/m)
  o	Temperature (18 °C)  

-	Material Properties 
  o	Aluminium 6061- T651
  o	Copper 

Assumptions 
1.	Steady state system 
2.	No fouling 
3.	No corrosion 
4.	Resistance in negligible 
5.	Incompressible fluid without phase changes 
6.	Tamb constant at (18 °C)  

Expectations 
•	The system shall lower the temperatures 
•	Uniform across the box but in particular on the: 
  1) SiPM,
  2) CCgM,  
  3) QIE boards.
•	The box shall be thermal neutral (should not vary the temperature of the surroundings components).
•	Pressure is 10 bars.
•	Structural Analysis 

Possible modification 
•	Alternative option to lower the temperature of the box is to replace SiPMs half wave in the HL-LHC run. 
•	Current model is two plates connected in series. We can test connecting plates in parallel.
•	The flow can be adjusted 
•	Eliminate grooves of the bottom plate. 
•	Having Copper on the bottom and top plate 
•	Tubes in parallel with a manyfold
